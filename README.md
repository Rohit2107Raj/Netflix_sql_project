# Netflix_sql_project
A SQL project on Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset where I explored and analyzed data to extract meaningful insights using advanced SQL queries. The project includes queries on aggregation, ranking, window functions, string manipulation, and conditional filtering to answer real-world business and analytical questions.
